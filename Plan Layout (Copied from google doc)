Cell phone/data plan

Idea: Trivago for cell phones/data plans
Name: CellCearch (Pronounced cell - search)
Client: Alia Nichol

BASIC DESCRIPTION/SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
This software will take basic knowledge from any given client, and based on an algorithm of array’s make a list of possible data plans for the user’s cellphone that may be best suited for them. Variables will be considered such as monthly budget, plan preference(Data, Pay as you go, etc.), and phone preference (Do you have a cell phone already or are you buying one new). 

The program will start up with a frame introducing the user to the program and then proceed to ask a few basic questions to the user. These questions will consist of information such as:
What is your monthly budget?
What do you want out of your plan? (Data, pay as you go, etc.)
And a couple more questions

Once the program has gathered all data, various links to real life data plans will appear to the user based on an algorithm.  At this point the user will have to browse the presented plans and see which ones are best suited for them. Once the user has selected a plan that they like, they will click on a link that will take them straight to that company’s website/page. And they can purchase the plan.

SKILLS NEEDED:
Data Sorting
GUI Interface
Specific search through array/list
Animations
Linking Real assets into the program

NOTE: these are links to a list of plans, not individual links to an individual plan.

BASIC ALGORITHM:
Get input from user on monthly budget and prefered plan type
  For monthly budget, create a range (not too large, likely 10-20 dollars under/over budget) with the inputted value as median
Search through main array for plan type
  Using search methods
Under specific plan type, search through associated subarray for specific budget range inputted by user
Output plans that are within requested range in list format
  Keep plans which are closer to actual value inputted by user at top of list
Get user to click on prefered plan from list given
Once clicked, output to user essential information of plan
  Initial information (Price, minutes, data, etc…)
  Company website
  Phone number
