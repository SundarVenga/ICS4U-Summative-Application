Cell phone/data plan

Idea: Trivago for cell phones/data plans
Name: CellCearch (Pronounced cell - search)
Client: Alia Nichol

See Slide Included

BASIC DESCRIPTION/SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
This software will take basic knowledge from any given client, and based on an algorithm of array’s make a list of possible data plans for the user’s cellphone that may be best suited for them. Variables will be considered such as monthly budget, plan preference(Data, Pay as you go, etc.), and phone preference (Do you have a cell phone already or are you buying one new). 

The program will start up with a frame introducing the user to the program and then proceed to ask a few basic questions to the user. These questions will consist of information such as:
What is your monthly budget?
What do you want out of your plan? (Data, pay as you go, etc.)
And a couple more questions

Once the program has gathered all data, various links to real life data plans will appear to the user based on an algorithm.  At this point the user will have to browse the presented plans and see which ones are best suited for them. Once the user has selected a plan that they like, they will click on a link that will take them straight to that company’s website/page. And they can purchase the plan.

SKILLS NEEDED:
Data Sorting
GUI Interface
Specific search through array/list
Animations

BASIC ALGORITHM:
Get input from user on monthly budget and prefered plan type
For monthly budget, create a range (not too large, likely 10-20 dollars under/over budget) with the inputted value as median
Search through main array for plan type
Using search methods
Under specific plan type, search through associated subarray for specific budget range inputted by user
Output plans that are within requested range in list format
Keep plans which are closer to actual value inputted by user at top of list
Get user to click on prefered plan from list given
Once clicked, output to user essential information of plan
Initial information (Price, minutes, data, etc…)
Company website
Phone number options


DETAILED ALGORITHM:

Loading screen plays in front of user for 5 seconds before opening the main menu to the program.
After the timer ticks for the loading screen, the main menu will be displayed with several options for the user to select that will be shown in top down menus. User Input is entered for monthly budget, prefered plans and their price ranges.
After everything is adjusted to the user’s liking the program will search the array’s, compare them to the user input, and selected matching plans. After the plans are selected, they will be inserted into a new array that will be shown to the user later on.
The list will then be modified via sorting methods to match the users budget from best to worst.
Once the new array’s been sorted and ready to present to the user, the next frame will present the array to the user in a list format, showing the company, plan type, fee’s, phone purchases (If selected), and a direct link to the page, which will have more details about the plan itself.
